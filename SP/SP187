===== Sample #1 Input =====
The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.
In the first line of a test case there is one positive integer n, not greater than 30000, which denotes the number of points. In the following n lines there are coordinates of points. Each line contains two integers x, y separated by a single space, 0  &lt;=  x  &lt;=  30000, 0  &lt;=  y  &lt;=  30000. The numbers in the i-th line are the coordinates of the i-th point.
