===== Sample #1 Input =====
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.  T test cases follow.  Each case starts with a line containing a single integer P. The next line contains 2P integers -- the constraints M[0], ..., M[2P-1].
&nbsp;
The following block of P lines contains the ticket prices for all matches: the first line of the block contains 2P-1 integers -- ticket prices  for first round matches, the second line of the block contains 2P-2 integers -- ticket prices for second round matches, etc. The last of the P lines contains a single integer -- ticket price for the final match of  the World Cup. The prices are listed in the order the matches are  played.
===== Sample #1 Output =====
For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is  the case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimal amount of money  Varva needs to spend on tickets as described above.
Limits
