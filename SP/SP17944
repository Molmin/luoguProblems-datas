Explanation
The example above don't show any concrete strategy. It just shows, that strategy must be coherent (when Mickey for given set of cards 1 2 3 4 leave on the table 3 2 1, then Donald for given cards 3 2 1 should answer with the number 4).
Generally You can implement Your own strategy satisfying the conditions below:

for Mickey's query "a1 a2 ... ak" You should reply "b1 b2 ... bk-1", such that {b1, b2, ..., bk-1} is subset of {a1, a2, ..., ak}
for Donald's query "b1 b2 ... bk-1" reply the number c, such that {b1, b2, ..., bk-1, c} = {a1, a2, ..., ak}
