===== Sample #1 Input =====
The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line
There is one integer n, 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 100 in the first line of each test case. This number is the size of matrices used for production of paintings. In the second line there is one integer x and in the third line one integer y, where 0 &lt;= x,y &lt;= 2n. The integer x is the number of columns and y is the number of rows that the upper matrix should be shifted by.
