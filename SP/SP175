===== Sample #1 Input =====
The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line
In the first line of a test case there is a number n, 3 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000, which equals the number of vertices of the polygon. The vertices of the polygon are numbered from 0 to n-1 clockwise. The following n-2 lines describe the triangles in the triangulation. There are three integers separated by single spaces in the (i+1)-st line, where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n-2. These are the numbers of the vertices of the i-th triangle in the triangulation.
===== Sample #1 Output =====
For each test case your program should produce one line with exactly one integer - the maximal number of triangles in the triangulation, that can be intersected by a single elementary triangle of the input polygon.
