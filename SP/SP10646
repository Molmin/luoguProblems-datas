===== Sample #1 Output =====
lose \ntie \ninvalid\n\nExplanation: \nCase 1: Player x can win by placing x in either last cell of the middle row, or the first cell of the last row. So the next player, o, cant prevent him from winning from this state. \nCase 2: It is completed game, as you can see no one has won. So, it has ended in a tie. \nCase 3: Player x should have started the game. Hence such a state can never be reached.
