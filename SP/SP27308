Explaination
Leha can obtain total score 4 in the following way.

    1. In the first step, he colors down left cell, all the neighboring cells of this cell are uncolored.
        So, it adds 0 to total score.
    2. In second step, he can color upper right cell, it also adds total 0 to the score.
    3. In third step, he can color top left cell. 
        There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this add 2 to the score.
    4. In the last step, he can choose the remaining down right cell. 
        There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. 
        So, this also add 2 to the score.

Leha can't obtain a score more than 4. Hence 4 is the answer.
