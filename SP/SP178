===== Sample #1 Input =====
The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.
In the first line of each test case there is an integer n, 1
===== Sample #1 Output =====
For each test case your program should write all the pairs of the neighbouring towns (i.e. their numbers). There should be one pair in each line. Each pair can appear only once. The numbers in each pair should be given in increasing order. Pairs should be ordered so that if the pair (a, b) precedes the pair (c, d) then a < c or (a = c and b < d).
Consequent test cases should by separated by an empty line.

Example
Sample input:
1
3
0 1 2
1 0 3
2 3 0

Sample output:
1 2
1 3
===== Sample #2 Input =====
1
3
0 1 2
1 0 3
2 3 0
===== Sample #2 Output =====
null
