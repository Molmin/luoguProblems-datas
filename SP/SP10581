===== Sample #1 Input =====
2\n-2\n1 -10\n\n3\n1\n-5 3\n6 -4 1\n0\n\n
===== Sample #1 Output =====
-1\n5\n\nNote:\nOn the first test case, the optimal solution is to take the ball with value 1, making you remove the ball\nwith value -2, resulting in -1.\nOn the second test case the best option is to take the ball with value 1 on the bottom row, resulting in\n1+3+1 = 5. \n
