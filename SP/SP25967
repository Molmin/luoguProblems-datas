Explanation-Initially no one has any friend.So community of '2' consist of only '2' i.e size-1. Then '2' and '3' becomes friends .This forms a community of 2 people. '4' and '5' also becomes friends.This forms another community of 2 people. '5' is unable to accept friend request of '3' (because it would result in a community of 4 people(>3).
