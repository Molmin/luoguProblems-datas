===== Sample #1 Input =====
The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.
The first line of each test case contains digit K,  K is en element of
{1,...,9}. The second line
contains number n,  1&lt;=n&lt;=10. In the following  n lines there is the series  of natural numbers
 a1,...,an,  
1&lt;=ai&lt;=32000 (for i=1,..,n), one number in each line. 
===== Sample #1 Output =====
The output for each test case composes of  n lines. The i-th line should
contain: 


 exactly one number which is the minimal length of K-representation of ai,
  assuming that such a representation of length not grater then 8 exists,
 one word NO, if the minimal length of the K-representation of the number
   ai
  is grater than 8.
