The difference as expressed through S is thus 0.\n\nCASE 2:   For the tops of the totem poles to meet, one totem pole must be pushed \napproximately 61.087 seconds before the other.\n\nCASE 3:   The tops of the totem poles will never meet, so you must print "-1" as shown. \n\n\nHint: \n\nPencil and Paper is the way to go! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
