===== Sample #1 Input =====
A common problem when processing incoming text is to isolate
the words in the text. This is made more difficult by the
punctuation; words have commas, "quote marks",
(even brackets)
next to them, or hy-
phens in the middle of the word. This punctuation doesnâ€™t
count as letters when the words have to be looked up in a
# dictionary by the 12345 "**&amp;! program.
