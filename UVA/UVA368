===== Sample #1 Input =====
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Indexing Web Pages&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Write a program to create an index of a small collection
of World Wide Web pages. Each "page" is a text file in a
special format called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The
HTML format includes regular text and special HTML commands,
which are always enclosed in angle braces. For example, the
string &lt;A HREF="layout.htm"&gt; is an HTML command meaning that
the following text should be highlighted; a user click on
the highlighted text would cause a web browser to fetch and
display the file layout.htm.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Following Links&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Don't forget that links can be &lt;A HREF="index.htm"&gt;
self-referential&lt;/A&gt;!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
&lt;A bunch of gibberish and a word&gt;
Note that there is no rule that the file needs to be legal HTML
(if you know the rules), or that words really be wordseiwlaoieu;a.
&lt;A HREF="index.htm"&gt;Watch out for mutual references!
