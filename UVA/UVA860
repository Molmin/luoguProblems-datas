Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
