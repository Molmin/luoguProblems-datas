OUR REVELS NOW ARE ENDED. THESE OUR ACTORS,
AS I FORETOLD YOU, WERE ALL SPIRITS, AND
ARE MELTED INTO AIR, INTO THIN AIR:
AND, LIKE THE BASELESS FABRIC OF THIS VISION,
THE CLOUD-CAPP'D TOWERS, THE GORGEOUS PALACES,
THE SOLEMN TEMPLES, THE GREAT GLOBE ITSELF,
YEA, ALL WHICH IT INHERIT, SHALL DISSOLVE,
AND, LIKE THIS INSUBSTANTIAL PAGEANT FADED,
LEAVE NOT A RACK BEHIND. WE ARE SUCH STUFF
AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON; AND OUR LITTLE LIFE
IS ROUNDED WITH A SLEEP.
