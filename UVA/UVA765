The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) [1] (through the extensions
defined in the Dynamic RARP (DRARP) [2]) explicitly addresses the problem of
network address discovery, and includes an automatic IP address assignment
mechanism.
The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) [3] provides for transport of a boot
image from a boot server. The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) [4] provides
for informing hosts of additional routers via "ICMP redirect" messages.
Works [1], [4] and [3] can be obtained via Internet.
